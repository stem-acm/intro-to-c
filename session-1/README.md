# "Hello, World!" Program in C

The code in the "hello.c" file is a simple C program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen. Let's break it down line by line:

1. `#include <stdio.h>`
   - This line tells the compiler to include the standard input/output library.
   - This library contains functions for reading input and writing output, like `printf`.

2. `int main() {`
   - This line declares the main function, which is the entry point of every C program.
   - The `int` before `main` indicates that the function will return an integer value.

3. `printf("Hello, World!\n");`
   - `printf` is a function used to print text to the screen.
   - The text in quotes is what will be printed: "Hello, World!"
   - The `\n` at the end is a special character that creates a new line after the text.

4. `return 0;`
   - This line returns the value 0 to the operating system.
   - A return value of 0 usually indicates that the program ran successfully.

5. `}`
   - This closing curly brace marks the end of the `main` function.

When you run this program, it will simply display "Hello, World!" on the screen and then exit.
